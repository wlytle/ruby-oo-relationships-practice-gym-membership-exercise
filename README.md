Word has just come from the higher-ups, and you're in charge of building out a domain that keeps track of weightlifters and the gyms they lift at. Yes gyms. Everyone knows you need a weekday gym and a weekend gym. And one for when you're traveling, and one that you go to just to show off. Oh, and that one with a really great steam room. Gotta love the steam room.

## Setup (Code Overview)

Your goal is to build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables. Do your best to follow Ruby best practices. For example, use higher-level array methods such as `map`, `select`, and `find` when appropriate in place of `each`.

We've provided you with a console that you can use to test your code. To enter a console session, run `ruby tools/console.rb` from the command line. You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here. Take a look at that file to see how you can pre-define variables and create object instances, rather than manually doing it in every single console session.

There are **no** tests! You will need to test your code on your own!!

**Troubleshooting:** If `ruby tools/console.rb` does not work, try running `bundle install` in your terminal.

## Deliverables

Here's what we need to be able to do.
